\title{Generate T sum statistics and p-values from simulation.}
\usage{
tsum_test(strscore, trim = 0.15, min.quant = 0.5, give.pvalue = TRUE,
  B = 9999, parallel = FALSE, cluster_n = NULL, cluster = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{strscore}{An exstra_score object.}

\item{trim}{Trim this proportion of data points at each quantile 
level (rounded up). Must be at least 0 and less than 0.5, but values close
to 0.5 may remove all samples and hence result in an error.}

\item{min.quant}{Only quantiles above this value are used in constructing the statistic.}

\item{give.pvalue}{Whether to calculate the p-value. As this can be slow it can be
useful to turn off if only the t sum statistics are required.}

\item{B}{Number of simulations in calculating null distributions. The denominator will
be B + 1, hence values of B = 10^i - 1 will result in p-values that are 
decimal fractions.}

\item{parallel}{Use the parallel package when simulating the distribution, creating the
required cluster. 
If cluster is specified then this option makes no difference.}

\item{cluster_n}{If parallel is TRUE, then the number of nodes in the cluster is 
 automatically set as 1 less than those available on your machine. 
 (but never less than 1). This option allows manual setting of the 
 number of nodes, either less to free up other resources, or more to 
 maximize available resources. 
If cluster is specified then this option makes no difference.}

\item{cluster}{A cluster object from the parallel package. Use if you wish to set up 
the cluster yourself or reuse an existing cluster.}
}
\value{
An exstra_tsum object with T statistics and p-values (if calculated).
}
\description{
When applied to an exstra_score object, T sum statistics are calculated as described
in Tankard et al. 
May also be applied on a pre-existing exstra_tsum that will regenerate the values.
