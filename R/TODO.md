# To do list

* Stop sample no-data plotting bug
* Plotting p-value distribution.
* Plotting T statistic distribution.
* Make qqplot method. 
* enable GRCh37 genome build (no "chr" at start)

Low priority
* Performance results of tsum_test when truth is known. (make column: str_score$samples$pos_control)
* Function to give significant results for a sample.

Done:
* Plotting exstra_tsum highlights only significant (BF) samples by default.
* tsum bracket method
