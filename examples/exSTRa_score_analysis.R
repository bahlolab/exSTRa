## ---- Plotting STR score ----
# Plot all loci:
# plot(str_score)

# restrict to only three interesting loci, for simplicity here:
( str_score_three <- str_score[c("HD", "SCA6", "FRDA")] )

# Plot the HD locus only:
plot(str_score["HD"])

# With custom colours:
plot(str_score, "HD", sample_col = c("WGSrpt_10" = "red", "WGSrpt_12" = "blue"))
# Add legend:
# TODO

# For many loci, plot to a file
# Most options not shown here should be passed onto plot.exstra_score() (equivalent to plot() on str_score)
# Without a file.base or directory, should just plot many ECDFs to the R device
# also can take mfrow or mfcol (not both) to place plots in an nr-by-nc array
exstra_mass_plot(str_score, dir = "PLACEHOLDER", file.base = "HiSeqXTen_WGS_PCR_2")


## ---- Performing tests for expansions ----
# here, the brackets mean the object is shown

# N_p_0.01:        20            5

summary(tsum, p = 0.05)    # by raw p-value
summary(tsum, p_bf = 0.05) # by p-value with bonferroni correction


# if you have positive controls, then if these are specified in

# "LOC" or "LOC1,LOC2,...": where LOC is the locus of a diagnosed expansion in that patient  
#                           Use a comma delimited list for more than one locus
# str_score$samples$neg_control
# "-": confirmed as a negative control for all loci, or can refer to a specific list for
#     all samples str_score$negative_control_loci
# "LOC" or "LOC1,LOC2,...": where LOC[#] are negatively tested loci
# NA for unknown samples
# ROC curves, AUC:
tsum_performance(tsum) 
# restricting to common SCAs and the similar Freidrich (sic) ataxia, likely to have been tested in SCA patients
